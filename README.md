# GSFTC: Graph-Spectral Filtering-enhanced Tensor Completion

This repository hosts the official implementation of **GSFTC**, a novel framework for high-dimensional tensor recovery.  
The code serves as the official implementation of the algorithm described in the paper published in *Advanced Engineering Informatics*.

## Contents

- `GSFTC.m` — main algorithm
- `helpers/` — tensor utilities
- `synthetic_demo.m` — quick demo script
- `dataset/`— datasets

## Usage
Run in MATLAB:
```matlab
synthetic_demo
```

## GNN model

The GNN models are trained and tested in accordance with the implementation in https://github.com/HazeDT/PHMGNNBenchmark.
